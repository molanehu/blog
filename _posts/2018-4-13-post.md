Since I figured out the "inview" part of my website, my new challange is how to convey the information as clear as possible. I always lean towards those "fancy stuff", such as various animations and effects. I think those effects really help me add more personailties and tones to my website. But I need to think about my users. They might from different ages. Some young people like me might know those fancy stuff, but for those who just want a website for educational use, I should have to be really careful. There is a potential "balance" in between, and I shall find it by making this websites. So far I finished the first 7 subpages, and I still need 3 more to go. I am sketching out my layouts in inDesign. I was so stressed out last week, but I have to say a big thank you for the people who helped me find those useful plugins and tricks :). I am still working on it.
