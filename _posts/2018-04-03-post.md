This is my 4/3 post

I started to interview my father's employer who has the most connections with the patients and knowledge of diabetes in his company. I also interviewed with a patient who has an optimistic attitude toward diabetes. She shared some of his experiences with me. I also did the research on diabetes. I explored the relative knowledge and tips of treating this illness through both Chinese and English websites. 

I made my first two sketches of my index pages. I decided to divide my websites into 10 individual pages: clothing, Eating, housing, traveling, exercising, testing, psychological adjustment, news, contacts, and medical brands. 

Instead of using the materials and icons from the Internet, I decided to draw the icons and patterns by myself. 

Here are the initial sketches of my index page: https://molanehu.github.io/indexplans/index%20plan.pdf
And the typography choices: https://molanehu.github.io/indexplans/typographydraft.pdf
