I styled the forms for my contact page, and tested with the email. It works. I also asked one of my Dad's costumer (an 63 years old grandpa). 
I asked him to use my website, and I am so happy that he could figure out how to use it without my instructions. He said my information are pretty 
useful and easy to read in both mobile and laptop. Since he could not read words in small sizes, he said he felt so appreciate that I made the font to be big enough for him to read. 
My next step will be figure out the domain and add more information to my wepage :)
