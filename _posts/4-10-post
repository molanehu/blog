This is my 4/10 post

I just finished the interview with my dad's employer, patient, and the doctor. I am trying to summarize their answers and arrange them in my template.
I also asked my friend in UCSD, who taught me how to use javascript to control css in order to achieve the "inview" animation through video call and "screen sharing app". I am half way finished the
interactive part of my index page. (To answer your question of my illustration: I used Ipad pro to draw all of the images in png format (transparent background), and I 
organized them in my folder). I still have 5 more pages to go. I will finished most of them by next Monday.
