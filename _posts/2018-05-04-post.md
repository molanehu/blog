After I interview with my Dad, he suggested me to add a "back to top" button in the bottom of each web page. Even if 
I want my users to read every single sentence in my webpages, I can save their time by adding a "back to top" button in 
the end part of each webpage, which will allow my users to browse through the whole page and help them to immediately jump to another webpage.
I also revised the interview part of each webpage. 
My final step is setting a domain for my website. 
I am ready for next week's final presentations :)
