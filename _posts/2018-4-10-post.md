This is my 4/10 post

I just finished the interview with my dad's employer, patient, and the doctor. I am trying to summarize their answers and arrange them in my template.
I also asked my friend in UCSD, who taught me how to use javascript to control css in order to achieve the "inview" animation through video call and "screen sharing app"(I am using some plugins for my code as well). I am half way finished the
interactive part of my index page. (To answer your question of my illustration: I used Ipad pro to draw all of the images in png format (transparent background), and I 
organized them in my folder). I still have 5 more pages to go (to draw the illustrations and organize the inforamtion). I will finished most of the layout by next Monday. I think I can do 3-5 sub pages that have the completed layout and animations for next Monday's 1st version due.
