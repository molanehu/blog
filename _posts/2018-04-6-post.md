Sketching the layout design
---

From this Tuesday class, I figured out how to do the round layout for my index page. I already make some hover animations and media queries for my index page layout. However, I tried my index page on my iphone, it still looks a little bit off...There is a huge amount of space on the bottom of my index page for the cell phone screen size display. I tried to set margins and paddings to be 0, but the strange things is still there. I am planning to solve this before next week. I also finished the 5/10 web pages sketches for my website (I drew those icon illustrations by ipad pro). Here is the link to it:molanehu.github.io/final-website-template-design-5of10/initial-web-template-sketches.pdf
My plan for this weekend is tring code my initial template design (maybe 3/5) and add "inview" in javascript for my webpages. Also, trying to finish the the rest web pages of my website.
