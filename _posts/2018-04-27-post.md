After the presentation from last Friday, I made some changes to my design: 
1. I will add a "email sending" feature for my contact page, so that my users will send their thoughts, 
ideas, suggestions, or problems to us directly. I am still working on styling the email sending box;
2. Before the presentation, I thought I need a "back to top" botton for my website. I started to test more users
in the beinging of this week. The KPI shows me that most of them are willing to go through the whole webpage instead of skipping
some parts or sections. I asked them about "back to top" button as well, some older users do not even know how to use that.
So what I am right now is just thinking just get rid of the idea of adding that feature. 
3. I will go back to my interviewers and asked them to offer me more information.
